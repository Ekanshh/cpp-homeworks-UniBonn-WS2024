This is a dummy repository with the structure for the homework.

Your task is to fill in the `main.cpp` files for each exercise so that they
perform what is asked in the exercise sheet 2.

# Results of the tests #
Every time you push to this repository, the automatic tests check your code.

Please wait till your pipeline finishes execution. You can see the progress in
the `Pipelines` section above.

Once the pipeline has finished you will be able to find the results of your
homework on the **Wiki** page of your fork of this repository.
