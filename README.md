# Homework folders for C++ courses

This is a dummy repository with the structure for the homeworks.

Your task is to fill the appropriate homeworks with your solutions to the given
homework sheets.

## Structure is important

We will only be able to test the homework if the structure of the project is
going to be **exactly** correct. Every homework will define a structure of the
folders that you will need to follow. If the structure is unclear to you, ask
you tutor for help.
