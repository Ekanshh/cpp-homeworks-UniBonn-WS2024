# Homework folder

## Structure of this folder

You have to add files to this homework.

- Create a single file `stack_limit.cpp` in `stack_limit` folder that outputs
  the memory you allocate on a stack to `stderr` when executed.
- Copy your `igg_image` project from previous homeworks and modify it to perform
  actions requested in the homework sheet.

```sh
homework_folder_4/
  |- stack_limit/
  |- igg_image/
  |- templates/
```
